donald -- the Mickey Mouse of dynamic linkers

donald doesn't really do dynamic linking... it's just the groundwork. In 
particular, it doesn't load depended-on libraries or apply relocations. It 
also doesn't implement TLS, except in a hacky way so that the initial thread 
can use TLS variables like errno.

It does do bootstrap relocation, auxv futzing, and mapping the segments of 
the executable. That's enough groundwork to be approachable for study 
purposes. I may expand it, but perhaps not much.
